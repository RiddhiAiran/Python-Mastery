# 🔢 Number Comparison Tool

A straightforward Python program that compares two numbers and provides meaningful feedback on their relationship.

## 📝 Description

This script prompts the user for two numeric inputs and:

- Compares the numbers to determine which is greater or if they are equal.
- Provides additional feedback if either or both numbers are zero.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **User Input**:
   - The user is prompted to enter two numbers (floating-point allowed).
2. **Comparison**:
   - Compares the two numbers using conditional statements.
   - Displays if one number is greater, smaller, or equal to the other.
3. **Zero Check**:
   - Additional logic checks whether either or both numbers are zero and displays a relevant message.

## 🧪 Example

```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 0
```

📤 Output:

```
🙏🏼-----Number Comparison----- 🙏🏼

-----Comparison Result-----

10.0 is greater than 0.0.

One of the numbers is zero.
```
