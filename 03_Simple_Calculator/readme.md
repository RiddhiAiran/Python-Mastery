🙏🏼-----Simple Calculator----- 🙏🏼

Addition: 8.0 + 3.0 = 11.0
Subtraction: 8.0 - 3.0 = 5.0
Multiplication: 8.0 * 3.0 = 24.0
Division: 8.0 / 3.0 = 2.6666666666666665
Modulus: 8.0 % 3.0 = 2.0
Exponentiation: 8.0 ** 3.0 = 512.0
Floor Division: 8.0 // 3.0 = 2.0

Thank you for using the Simple Calculator! 🙏🏼
